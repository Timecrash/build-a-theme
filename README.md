# a theme builder for Tumblr themes
> beta version
> newest update: day/night mode toggle!

## What is this for?

This theme builder lets you make a tumblr theme without needing to edit any code. 
It's intended for:
- Theme makers who are new and want a customized base code to start from
- Tumblr users who want to make their own personal theme but aren't sure where to start
- Anyone who wants a customized theme but doesn't want to code it!

## What kind of themes can I make?
Currently the theme builder supports these features:
- sidebars, headers, and footers
- grid, contained, and standard theme layouts
- plain, dashboard/mobile style, or chat bubble styled sidebars
- optional custom cursors
- optional transparent side images
- optional search bar
- optional day/night mode toggle

All themes made with the theme builder come with:
- custom color options
- background image option
- optional full sized background
- mobile friendly layout
- custom border width and border radius
- dashboard style captions
- jump pagination
- support for all post types including NPF posts
- meets theme garden submission requirements (when navigation is enabled)
- Global theme options (mobile theme, full options are visible when dashboard style sidebar is selected)

Since this is a beta release, more options are coming! 
Future updates will include:
- Header and footer style options
- more layout options (fansites, portfolio themes, etc)

You can fill out [the theme builder survey](https://href.li/?https://forms.gle/KDScN33F78BE5Gwm7) if you want to suggest a feature that isn't currently in this theme builder. Keep in mind this project is not intended to replace fully released themes. This is a starting point, so the layout options are still going to be relatively limited compared to what's out there already!

## How does it work?

Go to the theme builder: [https://cornetespoir.github.io/build-a-theme/](https://cornetespoir.github.io/build-a-theme/)!

Start selecting your options. 

The preview will give you an example of what your final theme will look like. 

Once you are happy with your options, click on "start using this theme" at the bottom of the options panel.
